## 📊 Case Study: Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

### 📝 Project Overview
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a fictional coffee shop chain during April 2023. The goal was to deliver a comprehensive, interactive report for stakeholders to monitor key metrics such as sales revenue, order volume, and product performance.

### 🎯 Objectives
Track and visualize total sales, total orders, and quantity sold.

Identify top-performing products and store locations.

Understand customer behavior by weekday, product type, and hourly trends.

Compare performance with previous months to detect growth or decline.

### 📌 Key Features of the Dashboard
**KPI Cards:** Highlight total sales ($119K), total orders (25,335), and quantity sold (36,469) with comparison to the last month.

**Date Filter:** Dynamic selection by month and date range for focused analysis.
